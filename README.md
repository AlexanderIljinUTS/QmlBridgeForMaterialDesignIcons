# QmlBridgeForMaterialDesignIcons

With the introduction of Qt Quick Controls 2, and the new Material Design theme, I decided to publish this small project, to make it easier to include the Material Design Icons webfont for QML applications. It is available under the SIL Open Font License, version 1.1, to match the Material Design Icons font.
